# CloudKarafka Management UI

This website is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is a static site-generator written in Ruby.

## How to run the site locally

**One time instructions:**

1. Make sure you have the latest version of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
2. Install jekyll and bundler `gem install jekyll bundler`
3. Checkout the repository locally and navigate to the folder via a terminal.
4. Run `bundle install`

**Whenever you work with the project:**

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

This will start Jekyll and start a built-in server that normally runs on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). It will detect file changes within the folders and regenerate the site. The full final site can be found in the folder `_site` after each build.

Press `Ctrl+C` if you need to end the Jekyll server at some point.
