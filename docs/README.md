# CloudKarafka Manager website

This is the home for the public website [https://manager.cloudkarafka.com/](https://manager.cloudkarafka.com/).

The website is built in a Ruby based web site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It comes with a simple web server and file watchers that you can run locally. Once you make any changes it will automatically generate a new static version of the website placed in `_site/`.

To run locally:

    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll serve
